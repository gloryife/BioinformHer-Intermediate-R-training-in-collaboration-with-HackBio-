# Differential Gene Expression Analysis

This project examines preprocessed gene expression data from an RNA-seq experiment comparing a diseased cell line with a healthy cell line treated with compound X.


# Tasks

- Generate a volcano plot. 
- Determine the upregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC > 1 and pvalue < 0.01)
- Determine the upregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC < -1 and pvalue < 0.01)
- Determine the functions of the top 5 upregulated genes and the top 5 downregulated genes
